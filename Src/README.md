PTAM
====

PTAM source code derived from Georg Klein and compiled well with bleeding edge dependencies.

How To Compile, refer to my blog:
*   [PTAM Compilation on Linux-HowTo](http://hustcalm.me/blog/2013/09/27/ptam-compilation-on-linux-howto/)

I use a Logitech Quickcam 9000 USB Webcam and utilizing V4L2 and Linux UVC under Linuxmint 15 with GCC 4.7.3, some modifications are needed to suit your own application(especially for using different Video Source, like IEEE 1394 Camera or Video files, etc. Also, do pay attention to your GCC version).
