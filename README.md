PTAM (Parallel Tracking and Mapping) re-released under GPLv3.

What is PTAM
------------

PTAM is a monocular SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system useful for real-time
6-DOF camera tracking in small scenes. It was originally developed as a research system in the Active 
Vision Laboratory of the University of Oxford, as described in the following papers:

- Georg Klein and David Murray, "Parallel Tracking and Mapping for Small AR Workspaces", Proc. ISMAR 2007
- Georg Klein and David Murray, "Improving the Agility of Keyframe-based SLAM", Proc. ECCV 2008


Previous PTAM release

PTAM was initially released in 2008 by Isis Innovation under a license suitable for
